#   → Sign up: https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key (2 minutes)
#   → Free: 500 requests/day
#   → No credit card required
#
# RECOMMENDED (Set up for redundancy):  
# - FMP_API_KEY: Second backup for additional reliability
#   → Sign up: https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs (3 minutes)

# Yahoo Finance Ban Recovery Strategy:
# 1. If Yahoo Finance gets banned (1-6 hours typical)
# 2. App automatically falls back to Alpha Vantage
# 3. If Alpha Vantage exhausted, falls back to FMP
# 4. This provides 750 backup requests per day (500 AV + 250 FMP)
# 5. Enough for analyzing large portfolios multiple times

# For deployment platforms:
# - Streamlit Cloud: Add these in App Settings → Secrets
# - Render/Railway/Heroku: Add as environment variables
# - Local development: Use this secrets.toml file

# Free Tier Limits Summary:
# - Yahoo Finance: Unlimited but rate-limited (can get banned)
# - Alpha Vantage: 500 requests/day free (no ban risk)
# - Financial Modeling Prep: 250 requests/day free (no ban risk)
# - Total backup capacity: 750 requests/day
# - Typical portfolio analysis: 20-50 requests

# Pro Tip: Set up Alpha Vantage immediately - it takes 2 minutes and 
# provides instant relief when Yahoo Finance is banned!
